# Indoor_Robot_Localization
Design of Robot capable of localizing itself in indoor environment and avoiding obstacles.
The project primarily focused on developing a robot based on PIC16F877A microcontroller that navigates inside a closed area using RFID tag mapping and avoids obstacles using infrared sensors. Contributed by developing the source code for PIC controller to detect RFID tags, move based on them and to avoid obstacles using IR sensor.
